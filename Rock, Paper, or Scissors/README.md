# JavaScript Syntax I | Rock, Paper, or Scissors
This project was created to build fluency in JavaScript fundamentals by practicing function syntax.

## [Project Prompt](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-javascript-syntax-part-i/modules/fecp-learn-javascript-syntax-functions/projects/rock-paper-scissors-javascript)
"Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:
* Rock destroys scissors.
* Scissors cut paper.
* Paper covers rock.
* If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

Our code will break the game into four parts:
1. Get the user’s choice.
1. Get the computer’s choice.
1. Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
1. Start the program and display the results."
